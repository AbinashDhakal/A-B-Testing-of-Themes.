## A/B Testing of Themes
# Introduction
The primary goal of A/B testing is to make informed decisions based on data, leading to improved user experiences and better business outcomes. This can be particularly useful when comparing different themes, such as dark mode and light mode on a website. A company can conduct A/B testing by setting each theme as the default for a specified period, collecting user interaction data, and comparing metrics like purchases, signups, and session duration to determine which theme performs better.


# Data Overview
The dataset contains information about user interactions with themes and various metrics such as Click Through Rate, Conversion Rate, Bounce Rate, Scroll Depth, Age, Location, Session Duration, Purchases, and Added_to_Cart.

P# erformance Metrics
Theme: dark or light
Click Through Rate (CTR): Proportion of users who click on links or buttons on the website.
Conversion Rate: Percentage of users who signed up on the platform after visiting for the first time.
Bounce Rate: Percentage of users who leave the website without further interaction after visiting a single page.
Scroll Depth: Depth to which users scroll through the website pages.
Age: Age of the user.
Location: Location of the user.
Session Duration: Duration of the userâ€™s session on the website.
Purchases: Whether the user purchased the book (Yes/No).
Added_to_Cart: Whether the user added books to the cart (Yes/No).

# Visualising Metrics
Create scatter plots and histograms to visually compare Click Through Rate, Conversion Rate, and other metrics between the light and dark themes.

# A/B Testing for Purchases
Conduct a two-sample proportion test to compare the conversion rates for purchases between the Light Theme and Dark Theme.

# A/B Testing for Session Duration
Perform a two-sample t-test to compare the average session duration between the Light Theme and Dark Theme.

# Findings
Click Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate showed no significant difference between themes.
Purchases did not exhibit a statistically significant difference in conversion rates between Light Theme and Dark Theme.
Session Duration had a slightly higher average for the Light Theme, but the difference was not statistically significant.
In conclusion, the analysis suggests that there are no clear and significant differences between the themes based on the examined metrics. Any observed variations may be due to random chance rather than a genuine impact of the themes on user behavior.
